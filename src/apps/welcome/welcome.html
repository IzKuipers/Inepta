<h1>Welcome to Inepta!</h1>
<p>
  I'm happy to have you! With Inepta I aim to show people how much is truly
  possible with Vanilla Javascript. There's no framework here! Inepta is written
  in vanilla HTML, CSS and Javascript. No NodeJS to be found.
</p>
<p>
  It's possible that technology detectors such as Wappalyzer detect Svelte or
  something like that, but they're wrong! If you don't believe me, open DevTools
  and see for yourself...
</p>
<p>Before you do though, I have one question for you. What's your name?</p>

<div class="username-field">
  <input id="nameField" type="text" placeholder="Username" />
  <button id="setButton">Set username</button>
</div>
