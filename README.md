# Inepta
A rather silly project to work on after ArcOS: Inepta is another attempt at creating an OS in the browser, this time making use of vanilla JS. I created this project to demonstrate what is possible with just plain old Javascript.

It runs under Electron, allowing me to use your device's filesystem to store files, along with a lot of other NodeJS module based stuff.

## Running inepta
Run these couple commands to run Inepta on your local machine:

```bash
$ git clone https://github.com/IzKuipers/silly
$ cd silly
$ npm install
$ npm run start
```

**NOTE:** you can use `Ctrl+Shift+Alt+I` to access the Developer Tools.
